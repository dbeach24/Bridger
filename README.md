## About

Bridger is a project to implement scalable document similarity search using a modern distributed computation framework (Spark).  The project implements a distributed KD-Forest algorithm for efficiently finding documents from a large collection which are similar to a given query document.

## Why "Bridger?"

Bridger is named for the [Bridger-Teton National Forest](https://www.fs.usda.gov/btnf) near the Grand Teton mountains in Wyoming.  It is the [5th largest forest](https://www.outdoorproject.com/blog-news/seven-largest-national-forests) in the United States, spanning over 3.4 million acres of public land.
